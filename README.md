# Food App - Web UI

This is the web ui for the DTD Food App. The purpose of this app is to streamline
the menu creation process in my fraternity house.

This application is created with Ember.js

The user can create a menu for either this week, or the next week. This involves selecting the meals
from the dropdown and finally generating the shopping list. After the purchase, the receipts can be added to
the correct weeks to keep track of the finances for the food committee.

This application was created because of the ineffectiveness of the current system which involved copy-pasting
from a google doc to create the menu and grocery list, a tedious and boring task. With this new system, the user is
capable of creating a menu and shopping list within minutes.
